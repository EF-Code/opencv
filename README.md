# Face Recognition with OpenCV

This is a simple Python project that uses OpenCV to detect and recognize faces using your webcam or an image file. It utilizes Haar Cascade Classifiers for face detection.

## Features

* Real-time face detection via webcam
* Face recognition using saved face image

## Requirements

* Python 3.x
* OpenCV

Install dependencies:

```python
 pip install opencv-python
```

## How to Use

### 1. Detect Faces in an Image

To run the static face detection:

```python
python detect.py
```

### 2. Detect Faces from Webcam

To run real-time face detection using your webcam:

```python
python detectCapture.py
```
